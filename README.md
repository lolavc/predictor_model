## [Predictor model project - Report](https://github.com/lolavc/predictor_model/blob/main/Multivariate4gh_191223.pdf)
Build a predictor model to evaluate coronary heart disease (CHD), considering potential risk factors. 
The dataset used is from a retrospective sample of males from Western Cape, South Africa, which has a high risk of heart disease. 
The data were collected throughout 2019.
### Tasks fulfilled:
1. Cleaned the data and obtained descriptive statistics.
2. The cleaned data was divided into training and test datasets. 
3. A logistic regression model was fitted in the training dataset using backward selection.
4. The optimal balance point for the sensitivity and specificity of the model was obtained through a ROC plot. 
5. The sensitivity, specificity and correct classification rate were evaluated in the training and test dataset. 
6. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, considering all the numerical variables after scaling the data and using the correlation matrix. 
7. The cumulative proportion of variance explained by the sequential components, the Kaiser Criterion and the Scree plot, were observed to decide the number of components to keep. 
8. A biplot was used to analyse the first two components.
